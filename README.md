# Alexander Zimdahl

## Quick Start Instructions


## Tools Used:
* VS Code
  * Preferred standard code editor
* GitHub Copilot/GitHub Copilot Chat
  * Used to autocomplete lines/blocks to improve speed and accuracy of code
  * Used to clarify intent and direction when stuck
  * Prompted to write base code after getting stuck to correct incorrect code and engineer base level functionality. Then I review the code to make sure it makes sense to me and will refactor as needed to either fix bugs or to resolve other needs/enhance desired behavior
* Google Search
  * Help with knowledge gaps and using unfamiliar concepts
* Angular Material
  * Installed Angular package for visually better UI components and simpler to implement to use for forms
  * Used for Input, Select, Multiselect, Button, Tooltips and Icons

## TODO:
* Fix:
* Feat:
  * UI/UX
    * Table styling
    * Lots and peak styling
    * I'm thinking show only the Search button with a confirmation modal that shows all the search options, w/ a generated summary in logical format for easy to read/understand
    * improve pagination
      * page size change
      * jump pages
  * Set up tests
* .NET
  * C# Files
  * Test cases
